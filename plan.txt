Writing App
===========

JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/eliasdorneles/spxqy8dL/6/#&togetherjs=3vfHVBhweq

TODO:
[X] fix word count to ignore spaces
[X] save automatically the text being written
[o] update the week streak widget as per the previously stored texts
    [X]  get list of formatted dates for the week
    [ ]  load from local storage the dates in the list
[ ] add some styling for better UI
[X] move out of jsfiddle and put code on github repo
[X] deploy it somewhere (maybe github pages? heroku, if needs backend)
[ ] test writing in a mobile phone

What is the minimum version of our app?

Use cases:

[X] user writes entry of the day
[ ] user see a streak of entries for the current week
[ ] user access any previous entry

[X] We count an entry as "filled" if it has more than 100 words.
